# Harðfiskur

Harðfiskur is a work-in-progress hobby chess engine, plus a basic UI written
with egui. It also provides an executable implementing the Universal Chess
Interface (UCI) (`hardfiskur_uci`).

Harðfiskur is a type of Icelandic dried fish, traditionally dried by air. It
resembles fish jerky and is often eaten with butter.
